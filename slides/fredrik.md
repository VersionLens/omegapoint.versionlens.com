## Problems to reach a successful product

* Ship a product that users actually want
* We have more requirements (demand) than developer resources (supply)
* We have internal translation issues


### More requirements than developers

### Translation issues

## AI can solve this to a large extent


### AI can be the developer

### No internal translation issue

## AI can solve this to a large extent, but...

## How do we trust the AI? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->



### When & how much should non-developers be involved in the product development process

* During the requirements phase? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* During the implementation phase? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* During the QA phase? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->



### Translation issue

* Today we spend lots of resources translating requirement → developer → code <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* What if we instead could spend those resources on translating requirement → solution → reality <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->




1. More ideas from non-developers than there are developers to implement them
    - AI developers can work all day and night!

2. Consequence: fewer ideas gathering dust in the backlog
3. Manager needed to filter, refine, and prioritize requirements
